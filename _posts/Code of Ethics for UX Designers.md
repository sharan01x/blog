While UX design is a relatively young field, its importance in a products success cannot be overstated. Its impact on the world today is clear but sadly its ability to effect positive change is coupled with its ability to inflict harm. As with anything that has such a powerful duality, a code of ethics is necessary to act as a lodestone to guide those that will venture into this field in the future.

Reflecting on the work of many others and that of my own work within the field, I have distilled the following rules that should act as a guide:

### Rule #1: Your foremost duty is to help your client succeed

I started my design career in Adobe Systems and then went on to build my own UX design agency. My ideas regarding this subject has gone from, “The designer’s job is to advocate for the user within a company” to “The designer is the servant of two masters and needs to figure out how to balance the two” and then to finally understanding that a company simply **_cannot_** have interests in opposition with that of its customers for any reasonable length of time as customers are not stupid people waiting to be tricked and will just switch to the nearest substitute. So it’s enough to simply take the interest of your client, their true long-term interest, and design for that. 

### Rule #2: Your task is to help a user simply navigate a complex world

Software is usually employed by a user for the completion of any reasonably complicated task. Depending on the user, they may be unfamiliar with how to use the software, use the hardware, understand how technology functions, or even have physical limitations such as not being able to see small fonts clearly. Our jobs as designers is to help them navigate the technology in such a way that it is very simple for them to achieve their tasks. We may need to help them understand the decisions they need make better, they may need settings that make interfaces more visible, they may rely on the software to make certain choices for them, etc. The better we understand our users, the better we can serve them. 

### Rule #3: Don’t treat the user like a commodity

The anonymity one has on the internet is a double edged sword. While it encourages free speech and discourse, it allows people to behave worse online than they would in real life. In the commercial side of the world, this extends to thinking of users of a product in the abstract, and reducing them to single dimensions, as pockets that need to be picked, resources that are meant to be exploited, rats that are meant to be subjects of dopamine experiments or as commodities that are meant to be traded. This is not good for the company in the long run (a la rule #1), but people attempt to do it anyway. Designers can play a big role in breaking this kind of mindsets and making product managers or companies look at the long-term welfare of their users and consequently, their own companies.

### Rule #4: Your counsel is as important as your labour

Far too often we measure our work by the effort we put or the number of screens and experiences we produce. But I’ve always felt that they hire you for your skills in the early part of your career and in the later part, they hire you for your opinions. When we’re designing something, we’re deeply considering a specific point, making decisions based on them and learning from their outcomes. It is this distillation of experience that is important to a client more than our labour. They shouldn’t have to spend new money to learn old lessons.

### Rule #5: A designer must respect cultures, genders, physical abilities, political leanings and must design to enhance them

Much too often we think only through the lens of our biases and it’s all too easy to exclude certain people or groups from our thinking. I am myself guilty of not accommodating people with poor eyesight and early on in my life as a designer, I’d design applications with small fonts because they made the interfaces so cool. But this meant I’d ostracise a large group of people that found it hard to read the small fonts.

An even more subtle example is the frustration that one feels while using tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Word or many other software, where they have to change the locale setting *every* time they create a new document as it usually defaults to ‘US English’ even if you’ve previously gone and set this to ‘Indian English’, ‘UK English’ or ‘Australian English’, or any of the many other dialects. I’ve seen people delivering food in India wearing t-shirts that say “Hunger Savior” instead of “Hunger Saviour” because someone forgot to change the locale setting while writing the copy for that t-shirt ! But there are even worse examples I have seen websites that use “Father’s Name” as a label for a field where “Parent’s Name” would have been more appropriate. Should someone really pick the option that says “childless”, even if they _chose_ not to have children and wouldn’t choosing “0” against children not be a more neutral choice! But here’s something that probably affects a lot more people —  the methods of proving that you’re a human by typing in the English text displayed in a box. The majority of the world **_doesn’t_** speak English natively!

Of course it is not possible to build for a global audience and keep absolutely everyone’s preferences in mind while doing so. But recognising that these biases exist in us will allow us to consider those that we affect unintentionally. And if there’s a good way to get feedback from users, this will go a long way to being more inclusive when designing applications. 

### Rule #6: Protect the privacy of your users

We’ve all heard about the dangers of our information being funnelled by and used by powerful systems to the benefit of the few. This is one of those areas that are really important and anyone that you speak to about it would agree is important. But there are very few people that understand the implications of the same on their own lives and even fewer that would choose a certain platform for the privacy features it offers. It is therefore even more important that product designers who are making the decisions on behalf of the users to be mindful of how the systems that they are designing protects their privacy.

Anne Cavoukian, the Information and Privacy officer of Ontario, proposed a set of seven foundational principles to protect the users of most information systems called “Privacy by Design” (PbD). The core idea is to address privacy concerns from the beginning, instead of adding privacy measures as an afterthought. PbD comprises seven foundational principles:

1.  Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial: Privacy by Design emphasises anticipating and preventing privacy invasions before they happen, rather than waiting for breaches to occur and then taking remedial action.
2.  Privacy as the Default Setting: Privacy should be built into systems and services by default, so users don’t have to take any action to protect their privacy. This means that personal data should be automatically protected without requiring any user intervention.
3.  Privacy Embedded into Design: Privacy should be an integral part of the design and architecture of IT systems and business practices. This ensures that privacy is not treated as an add-on but is a core component of the system or service.
4.  Full Functionality — Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum: PbD advocates for a “win-win” approach where both privacy and functionality are achieved, without compromising either. It rejects the idea that privacy must be sacrificed for security or other objectives.
5.  End-to-End Security — Lifecycle Protection: Privacy by Design emphasises the need for strong security measures throughout the entire data lifecycle — from collection to use, storage, and eventual disposal. This involves implementing robust access controls, encryption, and other security techniques.
6.  Visibility and Transparency: PbD emphasises being open and transparent about privacy practices, allowing users and other stakeholders to verify that privacy measures are in place and functioning as intended. This fosters trust and confidence in the system or service.
7.  Respect for User Privacy: Privacy by Design puts users at the centre, giving them control over their personal data and making it easy for them to exercise their privacy rights. This includes mechanisms for obtaining consent, providing access to personal information, and allowing users to correct or delete their data.

To make applications respect users’ privacy, follow these steps:

1.  Conduct a privacy impact assessment at the beginning of the project to identify potential privacy risks and develop strategies to address them.
2.  Design the application with privacy in mind, incorporating the Privacy by Design principles from the start.
3.  Collect only the minimum necessary personal data and anonymise or pseudonymise data where possible.
4.  Implement strong access controls and encryption to protect personal data in transit and at rest.
5.  Establish clear and transparent privacy policies, making them easily accessible to users.
6.  Offer users options to manage their privacy settings, giving them control over their personal data.
7.  Regularly review and update privacy practices, staying informed of changes in regulations and industry best practices.

### Rule #7: Reduce the carbon footprint

When e-commerce companies launched in India, every step of the many that began from the time the user completed the payment on a website to the final delivery of the product to the user’s home was new and untested. One of these processes was the way in which things were packaged.

It seems that someone had specified how things were packed and shipped as per the standards of another country and every product came with bubble wrap and oversized boxes regardless of the contents. But if anyone knows anything about the country, they know that Indians hate waste. Whether waste of the food on a plate or in business, it is not tolerated. So when these oversized boxes started showing up at people’s doorsteps when they may have ordered a lipstick, a deodorant or a bar of soap, people started to point it out!

This is when someone in the logistics department started to examine what was happening and adapted the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) to the waste-intolerant Indian conditions. There was a sharp change in the way packaging started to work post that across ALL ecommerce players. Boxes were replaced by envelopes when possible, clothes came wrapped in brown paper, number of shipments reduced and items got grouped, having items shipped to a neighbourhood store where the customer could go and pick up the item at their own convenience, and lots of other changes occurred over a very short time. To make someone do something good for the environment is not an easy task, but getting a company to do this is near impossible. But ecommerce companies were adopting these strategies across the board only because it was also in their own interest. 

So this got me thinking about the design interventions that we could bring that would benefit the company, the customer and the environment. Unsurprisingly there were a few ideas that immediately came to mind that I know these ecommerce companies could implement:

1.  Allow a user to specify the packaging that they want to be used for the products that they have ordered.
2.  Let the user specify whether they are in a hurry or don’t mind waiting and have their item be clubbed with other deliveries in the area. This allows the packaging department to not have to default to the “safest” option always.
3.  One of the biggest costs in recycling is the collection of materials. Food delivery companies can increase the value-per-mile metric of their delivery personnel by allowing them to pick up used plastic boxes from customers.
4.  Offer subscription options on products that are ordered frequently. This will optimise delivery routes and make them predictable.
5.  Let users tell the product manufacturers that they’d buy a more eco-friendly product if they had that as an alternative. This may encourage product manufacturers to create such alternatives if they see enough of a demand for the same.

These are just five ideas that came to mind with me spending a few hours thinking about what I could do. I’m sure if designers everywhere thought about this problem, much more impactful and creative solutions can be found. And that’s the main call to action in this rule.

### Rule #8: Design for Delight, not Addiction

Design is a very powerful tool that can help achieve any goal. There have been many shows and documentaries produced on how addictive it can make applications. Design can find many ways to grab the attention of users and [h](https://ve)ave them staring at your application endlessly. The only benefit to doing so would be to push more ads to the user or spy on them to build a profile of them to be sold to the highest bidder. But these are shortsighted goals and tactics. Awareness is rising among people. They realise that if the product is free, then they are the product themselves. 

In addition, there is a trend towards paying for software these days more than before, as evidenced by the growth of SaaS products and the consumer’s willingness to pay for digital content like on Netflix, Apple+ and others and even an increase in the use of cloud only products like the ever so popular Figma that most designers use. Such services rely less on ad revenue than on providing quality products and delightful experiences. 

The users of these services have well established that not only will they pay for quality products and services, but they will stay with the company for the long term. Compare this with software of yesteryears that would be uninstalled as soon as someone finished using it for the purpose they were downloaded for. When the costs of acquisition is going through the roof, wouldn’t you rather be the one that has the customer for the long term?

### Conclusion

Ethics involve principles and values that guide human behaviour and decision-making, often with a focus on concepts like fairness, justice, and moral obligation. Ethics encourage individuals and organisations to consider the broader implications of their actions on other people and the environment. These are the ways we can build societies that we want to live in ourselves. 

We UX designers now wield a lot of power and the ability to shape our digital worlds that we have come to inhabit more and more. It is time that we paid attention to our own actions and learnt the better patterns that lead to long-term well-being.
