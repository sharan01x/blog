*My foray into the world of 3D printing and my learnings and insights so far. This is work in progress and will continue to be edited.* 

# Why

I ran into 3D printers years ago in around 2015 I suppose. But the industry was nascent and the technology had really not been figured out as yet. The potential was alway there but having been initially thought of as something that would revolutionise ecommerce and logistics, it got pushed out into the periphery and became a niche to be engaged with by nerds and super-nerds only.  I have always been an adopter of new technologies, among the group called "pioneers" in business books. But being located in India at that time, it was firstly too expensive, secondly it would have been impossibly to order replacement parts, filaments and thirdly getting support from someone local would have been next to impossible.

However I ran into it again in 2023 when I saw this amazing YouTube video where this person had designed and printed all the shelves that he needed for his desk. He was even able to design and print SD card holders, in an angle to suit the height of his desk. This blew my mind! I don't know whether it is a universal feeling but visiting Home Depot or a craft store fills me with excitement at the potential of things that can be created. Getting a 3D printer had filled me with the same kind of feeling. I was imagining the possibilities of the kinds of things that could be made with it and had to get one to find out for myself. It was going to be an indulgence for sure, but I was willing to spend the money to find out what I'd learn in the process. 

# Finding the right printer

When I first ran into 3D printing, getting an object printed was more important it seemed than to make it easy for the user. Now, years after the industry had been around, things had got a lot more mainstream. The focus has definitely been on the user and getting things right for them. While there are a lot of videos that talk about fine-tuning printers and getting them to output things very accurately, a lot of printers will do a great job right out of the box and that's saying something!

In my case, the choice was made somewhat easier. There are essentially two kinds of 3D printing for mainstream use - Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) which uses a filament and Vat Polymerisation which uses resins for printing. The field is young and new methods of printing are being developed everyday, but these two kinds are most predominant in the consumers space. 

Resin based printing has its own set of challenges due to the need for ventilation and the smells that arise from using resin. Since I was looking for the printer to remain in my study, FDM was the way to go. But there are numerous FDM printer manufacturers available and after considerable research, I settled on a printer that would be easy to assemble, maintain and find support for in case I need that down the road. So I narrowed it down to the Bambu Labs X1 which is a slick looking printer and the Elegoo Neptune 4 Plus. But then I learnt that it uses proprietary parts and I definitely didn't want to be locked into any ecosystem and choose to go with the Neptune 4. The fact that there is an approximately $700 difference in price between the two did help and I was pleasantly surprised to get it for approximately $350 including shipping and a roll of white filament.
# Unboxing and setting up

The delivery took about a month as I had pre-ordered the Neptune before it had begun shipping and it arrived during the Christmas holidays. Perfect timing, as I had some down-time and could get into learning about 3D printing and building stuff. 

The setup was rather straightforward and I managed to build it without additional help as all the tools were supplied. There were some aspects that were complicated  There were a lot of YouTube content too that showed how those tricky bits could be handled. The most complicated part was making sure the right cables were plugged into each of the parts and checking if the right voltage settings were set on the printer bed, but though this wasn't too bad, you wouldn't expect a mainstream consumer device to require this level of assembly.

Tension tighteners are provided and were easy enough to operate, but one isn't always sure whether there's enough tension created. I'm prone to tightening things for a flush fit, but this may be more than required in some cases and any kind of indicators here that would let the user know that things are tight enough would be helpful.

After setting up and turning on the device, the desktop software had some nice surprises. It had shipped with some files ready to be used for the test run. Funnily enough, one of the files included was a tool stand that could be printed to attach to the printer and hold all the tools required by it. This was a nice touch!

The only other challenge I saw was with the placement of the printer itself. I cannot be pushed all the way to a wall or corner as the printing bed travels on a table and extends beyond the edges of the printer's body. I found out this space was needed only when I ran the first test print and the print bed slides to the extreme positions before printing and hit the wall at that time. So one needs to allow enough room for that.

# Insights

* The plugging in of the cables for the gantry motors still requires some amount of understanding of connectors. This could be further simplified in future versions.
* The printer plate travels outside the frame of the printer itself which allows a user to make the mistake of placing it too close to a wall and having to learn *during printing* that it needs to be moved. This could be explained as well.
