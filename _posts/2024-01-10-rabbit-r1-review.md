# The Keynote

If you said that the Rabbit team copied the Steve Jobs keynote style, it would be an understatement. The only thing missing was the Vera Wang turtleneck. It was a black t-shirt instead, but otherwise the same slide style from Apple Keynote with the gradient and the same format, including the "One more thing..." announcement in the end.

Why? Probably because VCs expect this kind of a thing. 

# Background

The tech-world has been in pursuit of two things for the past couple of years:

1. An answer to what replaces the smart phone: Depending on who you ask, the smartphone has been relatively the same since its debut in 1997.
2. An AI assistant that is ubiquitous: AI assistants have really proven their usefulness since ChatGPT launched to the public, an ENTIRE YEAR ago. People have been looking for ways to bring it out of the browser and into the lives of the users as ubiquitous availability and context matters.

Apple proudly used the line, "There's an app for that" in their marketing to highlight how many apps there were in the App Store. The CEO of Rabbit uses that same line to highlight how each of the apps are actually silos that don't work together and the user ends up clicking so many buttons in each app instead to make something happen. For example, travelling somewhere on a vacation requires an app for flight bookings, an app for hotel bookings, an app to book a ride and another to research the highlights of the destination. And each of them will ask you for your name, dates, times and locations, your companions, your preferences, over and over again. This *is* a problem today and this company used this idea as the foundation to build their solution to address.

But unlike me, this CEO spends very little time being fascinated by this absolutely ground-breaking point and instead goes on to explain the solution they've created. And it's simply brilliant.

# The User is in Control

The Rabbit is a device like a smart-phone, but the user's credentials are within their own control. They have an interface called Rabbit Hole, where the user can login and authorise their Rabbit to use the third-party app. This means that the user doesn't have to share their app credentials with Rabbit. 

While this is great for the user, I think Rabbit may gate-keep the services being added into the Rabbit OS. This is potentially where they make their money and control quality. But also a potential bottle-neck.

# The Potential Problems

* Every phone manufacturer will copy this, there's no moat
* Apps of the future will not work the way they do right now such as using login credentials and the Rabbit will have to do things differently in the future
* Payments is going to be a challenge -- truly global just-in-time payments is essential for the future
* The scroll wheel will go in future versions, it's simply unnecessary
* The Rabbit Hole is a potential bottleneck
