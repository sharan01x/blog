*If we get feedback and feature requests from users regarding products we've built, we get valuable insights into understanding what the users want. This is a great place to involve LLMs to handle the issues involved in this process.* 

___

# Overview

This feedback system will do the following:

1. It will allow users to submit their feature requests
2. To handle the problem of faster horses, it will produce a page where users can vote on things they didn't think of before
3. It will show a priority list to product teams that will allow them to understand what to develop next
4. The same idea can be ported to handling bugs, but it needs to be a separate system altogether
