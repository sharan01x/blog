<p>Iâ€™m Sharan, a developer-turned-designer. I have worked on over 95 projects in my career with clients large and small. I have run a top-100 UX Design agency in the past and am the Chief Design Officer of a Web3 company today.</p>

<p>This website is organised as a progression of ideas, which turn into experiments, that finally get implemented in projects. And the few ideas that endure the test of time, I document as principles. I use this website to reflect upon my work and hope it will prove useful to other fellow designers as well.</p>
