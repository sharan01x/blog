                <p><em>My foray into the world of 3D printing and my learnings and insights so far. This is work in progress and will continue to be edited.</em></p>

<h1 id="why">Why</h1>

<p>I ran into 3D printers years ago in around 2015 I suppose. But the industry was nascent and the technology had really not been figured out as yet. The potential was alway there but having been initially thought of as something that would revolutionise ecommerce and logistics, it got pushed out into the periphery and became a niche to be engaged with by nerds and super-nerds only.  I have always been an adopter of new technologies, among the group called “pioneers” in business books. But being located in India at that time, it was firstly too expensive, secondly it would have been impossibly to order replacement parts, filaments and thirdly getting support from someone local would have been next to impossible.</p>

<p>However I ran into it again in 2023 when I saw this amazing YouTube video where this person had designed and printed all the shelves that he needed for his desk. He was even able to design and print SD card holders, in an angle to suit the height of his desk. This blew my mind! I don’t know whether it is a universal feeling but visiting Home Depot or a craft store fills me with excitement at the potential of things that can be created. Getting a 3D printer had filled me with the same kind of feeling. I was imagining the possibilities of the kinds of things that could be made with it and had to get one to find out for myself. It was going to be an indulgence for sure, but I was willing to spend the money to find out what I’d learn in the process.</p>

<h1 id="finding-the-right-printer">Finding the right printer</h1>

<p>When I first ran into 3D printing, getting an object printed was more important it seemed than to make it easy for the user. Now, years after the industry had been around, things had got a lot more mainstream. The focus has definitely been on the user and getting things right for them. While there are a lot of videos that talk about fine-tuning printers and getting them to output things very accurately, a lot of printers will do a great job right out of the box and that’s saying something!</p>

<p>In my case, the choice was made somewhat easier. There are essentially two kinds of 3D printing for mainstream use - Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) which uses a filament and Vat Polymerisation which uses resins for printing. The field is young and new methods of printing are being developed everyday, but these two kinds are most predominant in the consumers space.</p>

<p>Resin based printing has its own set of challenges due to the need for ventilation and the smells that arise from using resin. Since I was looking for the printer to remain in my study, FDM was the way to go. But there are numerous FDM printer manufacturers available and after considerable research, I settled on a printer that would be easy to assemble, maintain and find support for in case I need that down the road. So I narrowed it down to the Bambu Labs X1 which is a slick looking printer and the Elegoo Neptune 4 Plus. But then I learnt that it uses proprietary parts and I definitely didn’t want to be locked into any ecosystem and choose to go with the Neptune 4. The fact that there is an approximately $700 difference in price between the two did help and I was pleasantly surprised to get it for approximately $350 including shipping and a roll of white filament.</p>
<h1 id="unboxing-and-setting-up">Unboxing and setting up</h1>

<p>The delivery took about a month as I had pre-ordered the Neptune before it had begun shipping and it arrived during the Christmas holidays. Perfect timing, as I had some down-time and could get into learning about 3D printing and building stuff.</p>

<p>The setup was rather straightforward and I managed to build it without additional help as all the tools were supplied. There were some aspects that were complicated  There were a lot of YouTube content too that showed how those tricky bits could be handled. The most complicated part was making sure the right cables were plugged into each of the parts and checking if the right voltage settings were set on the printer bed, but though this wasn’t too bad, you wouldn’t expect a mainstream consumer device to require this level of assembly.</p>

<p>Tension tighteners are provided and were easy enough to operate, but one isn’t always sure whether there’s enough tension created. I’m prone to tightening things for a flush fit, but this may be more than required in some cases and any kind of indicators here that would let the user know that things are tight enough would be helpful.</p>

<p>After setting up and turning on the device, the desktop software had some nice surprises. I guess they understood that one of the first things anyone wants to do is to print something. So they had shipped the memory stick that comes with it with some files ready to be printed. Someone had understood their users really deeply as one of the files included was a tool stand that could hold all the tools for the printer. A very nice touch.</p>

<p>The only other challenge I saw in the unboxing was with the placement of the printer itself. It has a printing bed that moves and positions itself below the print head. As such, the bed can move about 5 inches beyond the frame of the printer in the front and back and needs that additional space. I found this out only when I ran the first test print and the print bed hit the wall at that time. But this is very much like the experience of finding out that regular desktop printers also need that additional space to allow the insertion and ejection of paper from them.</p>
<h1 id="designing">Designing</h1>

<p>This bit is the biggest problem for the space. There are broadly two different kinds of tools for 3D design - tools that are meant to be used for sculpting (like Blender) and those meant for functional 3D design (like OnShape). Sculpting tools are great for creating characters and objects that don’t necessarily have to do anything but look good, whereas the functional 3D design is used to create tools and objects that need the parts to work together to perform an action, like tools, stands, cases, etc.</p>

<p>I am more interested in product design and went down this route and I find that OnShape has the best tools in this space. Though it is completely cloud based, the tools are pretty responsive and great and you can be sure you’re always using the latest version of the tool.</p>

<p>Speaking of pricing, this is one the areas that need to be improved in this space. I think 3D design was a niche pursuit before so the pricing reflected that. No one but serious product designers were working in this space and their needs were being addressed by tools like Autodesk Fusion 360 which probably had to charge an arm and a leg to stay profitable because of the smaller user base. But I find that the printers have become cheaper and the sales trends are pointing up and to the right and the user adoption is increasing. So it’s about time that friendlier pricing is the need of the hour. The tools themselves don’t need to offer the pro-level features such as parts libraries, teams functionality, version control and such and could instead develop features that are more tuned to hobbyists which may also be useful in creating a lower price.</p>

<p>Designing tools are also very difficult to learn. The process across all the tools in the space seems to be that you need to imagine the 2D cross-sectional shape of the 3D object you’re building and then extrude or turn this into a 3D object. You almost need to imagine what shape the shadow of the 3D object will cast on a surface in order to create the 3D object. And you can draw shapes in the X, Y and Z planes and imagine them interacting with each other. That is pretty hard to do. This is something that can only be achieved through a lot of practice. But this is also the biggest hurdle for most new designers that needs to be addressed by tooling providers. I have thoughts on this subject and will write a more detailed blog when I have dealt with this subject a lot more.</p>

<h1 id="design-marketplaces">Design Marketplaces</h1>

<p>While tools are very difficult to learn and use, there are a lot of websites that collect and host designs produced by designers like <a href="https://www.printables.com">Printables</a> and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a>. Anyone can simply get on those websites and type in what they’re looking for and in most cases download the printable files for free and print it on their 3D printers. You feel this sense of power when you do it for the first time. You can go from finding what you want to actually having it in your hands in a matter of hours! One day delivery seems so passé!</p>

<p>But it’s not all roses and rainbows as there are no quality checks as yet and new designers in the space (like me) also post designs that may yet not be ready for use by masses. In some cases I’ve downloaded and printed things which failed to print properly as some minor setting somewhere needed to be turned on or off before doing so, which a more seasoned designer would have taken care of before publishing those files. But still, I don’t think this is something that the websites should look to control. The failures have been much less than the successes.</p>

<p>The area that I do think needs fixing is the publishing of the dimensions of the printed objects which strangely doesn’t get published by all publishers and the website doesn’t seem to instruct them to publish. You’d think you could see the photos of certain objects and be able to determine the size of the object that will come out in the end, but that’s not always true and it’s definitely never true when you’re trying to find something that needs to fit a 20mm tall table-top and 24mm would just not be good enough.</p>

<p>Also, the amount of filament it will consume or the time the object will take to print aren’t usually captured on these sites either.</p>

<p>These marketplaces are also aimed at people that own 3D printers. I think there is a massive commercial opportunity here to enable it to be used by end-users who want the object instead. I’d be so happy to support and invest in any project that may aim to do this. So if you’re a developer looking for a project to work on, hit me up and we could build this thing together.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>WIP: The text below is still work in progress.</em></p>
<h1 id="printing">Printing</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Speed of drying of the filament could play a role!</li>
  <li>Too many printer settings</li>
  <li>Removing it too early</li>
  <li>Noise</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hurdles-and-insights">Hurdles and Insights</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The plugging in of the cables for the gantry motors still requires some amount of understanding of connectors. This could be further simplified in future versions.</li>
  <li>The printer plate travels outside the frame of the printer itself which allows a user to make the mistake of placing it too close to a wall and having to learn <em>during printing</em> that it needs to be moved. This could be explained as well.</li>
  <li>Going from 2D to 3D is incredibly difficult and staying in the 3D space from the start would be ideal, but the tools we have today are limited in their ability to express these ideas.</li>
  <li>Marketplaces are currently aimed at those that own 3D printers, whereas they should be aimed at the end-users of the products that are available on the sites.</li>
</ul>
